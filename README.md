# Prioritizing tests for the Covid-19 virus

## Introduction:


This repository presents a novel approach to COVID-19 testing, aiming to enhance efficiency in laboratory operations and reduce the spread of the virus. The proposed method suggests testing individuals based on their risk profiles and probability of being infected with COVID-19, rather than relying on random selection as commonly practiced in laboratories today. By prioritizing individuals with higher risk profiles, this approach seeks to minimize transmission rates and promote targeted containment measures. To evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy, a simulation is constructed, comparing two populations in different countries. The simulation assumes that populations in both countries are identical at a specific time (t0), and a limited number of tests are available daily. Additionally, it considers the contagiousness of untested infected individuals based on predefined infection distribution, while tested individuals are assumed to be isolated and non-contagious once identified. Through this simulation, we aim to provide insights into the potential benefits of risk-based testing and its impact on curtailing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
