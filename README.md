## Introduction
MATRISK POOLING is based on building risk profiles for subjects and placing them in innovative pooling matrices in a precise way that minimizes the number of tests required to identify patients with the virus. This placement method overcomes the structural limitations of traditional pooling methods and allows decision-makers to use the method widely, even with high infection rates in the population, which typically limit the use of pooling.

## Features
- **Efficient Testing**: Reduces the number of tests required by strategically placing subjects in pooling matrices.
- **High Adaptability**: Effective even with high infection rates, unlike traditional pooling methods.
- **Proven Results**: Tested on real data from the Israeli Ministry of Health with unprecedented results.

## Installation
To install and run MATRISK POOLING, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrisk-pooling.git
